🧠 Projects Included

1. Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator

Calculates statistical measures for matrix inputs.

Uses NumPy for efficient computation.



2. Demographic Data Analyzer

Analyzes census data from adult.data.csv.

Calculates race counts, average age, education stats, salary insights, etc.



3. Medical Data Visualizer

Cleans and visualizes health data using heatmaps and categorical plots.

Helps identify patterns in medical examination datasets.



4. Sea Level Predictor

Uses historical data to predict future sea levels.

Includes regression analysis and visualization.



5. Page View Time Series Visualizer

Visualizes page view trends with line, bar, and box plots.
